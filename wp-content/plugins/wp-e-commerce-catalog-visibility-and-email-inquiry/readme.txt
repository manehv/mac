= WP e-Commerce Version Compatibility =

Please note that WP e-Commerce Catalog Visibility and Email Inquiry requires that you have <strong>WP e-Commerce version 3.8.9 and after</strong> to work. Older versions of WP e-Commerce do not support the functions to hook the email inquiry button to the add to cart button.

= WP e-Commerce Theme Compatibility =

Whilst you might have version 3.8.9 your theme may still use an earlier version of code. For the Product Page Rules Hide Add to Cart and Show Email Inquiry button to work on the single product pages and product cards the theme must have these 2 core WP e-Commerce functions:

* code do_action('wpsc_product_form_fields_begin')
* do_action('wpsc_product_form_fields_end')

in these files:

* wpsc-grid_view.php
* wpsc-list_view.php
* wpsc-products_page.php
* wpsc-single_product.php

= a3rev Plugins Lite & Pro Version Admin Interface =

* All a3rev Lite Version plugins have exactly the same admin interface as the Pro Version.
* Pro Version features and settings are inside of a Yellow border.
* The Pro Version settings are all active on the admin panels But do not save and are not applied to the front end.
* Upgrading to the Pro version activates all the Pro version Features and Settings and removes the Yellow side bar and borders.

= Lite Version Support =

* As a Lite Version user please post all support requests to the plugins WordPress Support forum.

* Tweak - Updated plugins support forum link to the wordpress support forum.
* Fix - Replaced hardcode iso-8859-1 charset to dynamic get_option('blog_charset')
* Fix - Updated all JavaScript functions so that the plugin is compatible with jQuery Version1.9 and backwards to version 1.6. WordPress still uses jQuery version 1.8.3. In themes that use Google js Library instead of the WordPress jQuery then there was trouble because Google uses the latest jQuery version 1.9.

* Fix - Email Delivery address - when the plugin is installed it now checks for WP e-Commerce Store Admin Email address and uses that if one has been entered. If it does not find a Store Admin Email Address, then it checks for and uses the WordPress admin email address. The WP e-Commerce Store Admin Email address always takes priority the WordPress Admin email address. This means that if the Store admin address is entered after the WP e-Commerce Catalog Visibility an Email Inquiry is installed it auto becomes the plugins delivery address.

= 1.0.4 - 2013/01/19 =
* Tweak - Added auto support for custom button type for 'add to cart' button so that our plugin can find the add to cart button on themes that use custom button code.

* Tweak - Updated Support and Pro Version link URL's on wordpress.org description, plugins and plugins dashboard. Links were returning 404 errors since the launch of the all new a3rev.com mobile responsive site as the base e-commerce permalinks is changed.

= 1.0.2 - 2012/08/27 =
* Tweak: Updated WordPress description text and readme to show the WP e-Commerce 3.8.8.5 do_action functions that must be included in themes for the Email Button to show. Some older themes don't have updated function and even though users have the 3.8.8.5 WP e-commerce version the button can't show.
* Fix - Combined button and pop-up window style scripts in one script to overcome javascript conflict with some IE javascript styling scripts.
* Documentation - Plugin documentation completed.

= 1.0.1 - 2012/08/25 =
* Tweak - Removed left and right 10px float and set so button left / right float is the same as the add to cart button.
* Fix - Moved style from header to footer to resolve plugin breaking themes css in IE 7, 8 and 9
